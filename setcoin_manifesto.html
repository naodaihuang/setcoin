            <h2>Part I: What is Unjust Today</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>A civilization that can simulate intelligence struggles to simulate fairness. [cite: 1]</p>
            [cite_start]<p>We live in an age of exponential progress, yet we are bound by an ancient and ugly tendency: wealth concentrates. [cite: 2] [cite_start]Like gravity, it pulls resources toward a denser and denser core, creating a power-law distribution that leaves a few with vast fortunes and the vast majority with near-zero balances. [cite: 3] [cite_start]Economists have long observed this statistical drift; it is not a flaw in the system, it is the system itself. [cite: 4]</p>
            <p>In response, our political institutions build ever more complex machines of redistribution. [cite_start]Tax codes warp into thousand-page Rube Goldberg contraptions. [cite: 5] [cite_start]Welfare programs get entangled in bureaucracy, and noble ideas like Universal Basic Income often die in committee. [cite: 6]</p>
            [cite_start]<p>The result is a world where opportunity is inherited, not earned, and where dignity is a luxury. [cite: 7] [cite_start]The engine of inequality runs faster than our reforms can dilute it, and a billion-person world of unbanked, excluded talent waits for a promise that never arrives. [cite: 8] [cite_start]This is the injustice we can no longer accept. [cite: 9]</p>
        </section>

        <section id="part2">
            <h2>Part II: What We Imagine Instead</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>Imagine opening your phone one morning to find an alert: a small windfall has landed in your wallet. [cite: 9] You did nothing to earn it. [cite_start]An algorithm spun a global roulette wheel, and your address came up. [cite: 10] [cite_start]Tomorrow, it might be someone in Rio or Reykjavík. [cite: 11]</p>
            [cite_start]<p>This is Random Transfer of Wealth (RTW), the heart of SET Coin. [cite: 11] [cite_start]It is not a handout; it is a counter-entropy pulse injected directly into the economy. [cite: 12] [cite_start]We envision an automated basic-income engine living on a public blockchain, governed by a single, unwavering rule: a small slice of the total money supply-one percent a year-will jump at random from wherever it is held and land only in the accounts of verified individuals. [cite: 13] [cite_start]Every coin, whether in a billionaire's hedge fund or a village credit coop, is subject to the same law. [cite: 14]</p>
            [cite_start]<p>This mechanism is designed to be less like charity and more like economic weather: unpredictable in the small, predictable in the large, and impossible to lobby. [cite: 15] [cite_start]It is a perpetual Jubilee, automated and continuous, where the floor of wealth for everyone can rise faster than the ceiling for a few. [cite: 16]</p>
            [cite_start]<blockquote>We imagine a world where wealth is not a stagnant pool, but a flowing river, constantly nourishing the entire economic landscape. [cite: 17]</blockquote>

        <section id="part3">
            <h2>Part III: What We Commit To</h2>
            <p>A vision requires principles. [cite_start]A revolution requires responsibility. [cite: 18] [cite_start]We commit not just to a new technology, but to a new standard of justice. [cite: 19]</p>
            
            [cite_start]<p><strong>We commit to automation without alienation.</strong> [cite: 20]<br>
            [cite_start]We will use civics-grade code, not casino capitalism, to replace the friction and bias of bureaucracy with the elegance of mathematical randomness. [cite: 20] [cite_start]Our goal is an automated system that serves human dignity, not one that deepens the divide. [cite: 21]</p>

            [cite_start]<p><strong>We believe dignity is not a luxury.</strong> [cite: 22]<br>
            [cite_start]This system is designed to dodge the dependence trap. [cite: 22] [cite_start]The expected gains are enough to provide basic security but not replace work. [cite: 23] [cite_start]Behavioral economics shows that such windfalls-unpredictable and feeling like found money- are often spent on upward mobility: school fees, engine repairs, a new tool for a trade. [cite: 24] [cite_start]It is a system that smooths the shocks of life, freeing people to take the small risks that lead to larger ladders of opportunity. [cite: 25]</p>
            
            [cite_start]<p><strong>We build not just a system, but a standard of fairness.</strong> [cite: 26]<br>
            [cite_start]Our work implements a profound ethical principle as code: Rawls's "veil of ignorance." [cite: 27] [cite_start]The system is designed as if none of us know where we will land in society. [cite: 28] [cite_start]Every holder faces the same one-percent haircut; every verified person shares the same lottery odds. [cite: 29] [cite_start]This is fairness, written in software. [cite: 30]</p>

            <p><strong>We commit to an architecture of access.</strong><br>
            [cite_start]Our foundation will be secure, programmable, and built for a billion users. [cite: 31] [cite_start]We will ensure that ordinary transfers are always free, because financial inclusion cannot have a cover charge. [cite: 32]</p>

        <section id="part4">
            <h2>Part IV: What We Ask From the World</h2>
            [cite_start]<p>Al is about to amplify winner-take-all dynamics; in this decade, we must build a counter-force just as automatic. [cite: 33, 34] [cite_start]Blockchain tooling is finally mature enough to make this possible. [cite: 35] [cite_start]Before the next billion are left behind, we must act. [cite: 35]</p>
            [cite_start]<p>The vision of SET Coin is a public good, and it demands a global coalition. [cite: 36]</p>
            [cite_start]<p><strong>We ask developers, cryptographers, and researchers:</strong> Help us build this. [cite: 37] [cite_start]Scrutinize our code and poke holes in our math. [cite: 37] [cite_start]The challenge of creating a fair, private, and universal digital identity is immense. [cite: 38] [cite_start]We open our work to you and invite you to help us solve it. [cite: 39]</p>
            [cite_start]<p><strong>We ask foundations, NGOs, and social organizations:</strong> We offer you a tool. [cite: 40] [cite_start]Imagine your programs running on a platform where aid is direct, transparent, and imbued with the dignity of surprise. [cite: 41] [cite_start]We ask you to build with us. [cite: 42]</p>
            [cite_start]<p><strong>We ask businesses and service providers:</strong> Join this new economy. [cite: 42] [cite_start]See this not as a cost, but as a gateway to the largest untapped market on Earth. [cite: 43] [cite_start]Offer your services, from education to internet access, and become part of a truly global and inclusive marketplace. [cite: 44]</p>
            [cite_start]<p><strong>We ask every individual who feels the injustice of our time:</strong> This is not a thought experiment. [cite: 45] This is a call to action. [cite_start]Discuss these ideas, challenge the status quo, and join the community of pioneers who believe a better world is not only possible, but programmable. [cite: 46]</p>
