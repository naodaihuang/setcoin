            <h2>Part I: What is Unjust Today</h2>
            <p>A civilization that can simulate intelligence struggles to simulate fairness.</p>
            <p>We live in an age of exponential progress, yet we are bound by an ancient and ugly tendency: wealth concentrates. Like gravity, it pulls resources toward a denser and denser core, creating a power-law distribution that leaves a few with vast fortunes and the vast majority with near-zero balances. Economists have long observed this statistical drift; it is not a flaw in the system, it is the system itself.</p>
            <p>In response, our political institutions build ever more complex machines of redistribution. Tax codes warp into thousand-page Rube Goldberg contraptions. Welfare programs get entangled in bureaucracy, and noble ideas like Universal Basic Income often die in committee.</p>
            <p>The result is a world where opportunity is inherited, not earned, and where dignity is a luxury. The engine of inequality runs faster than our reforms can dilute it, and a billion-person world of unbanked, excluded talent waits for a promise that never arrives. This is the injustice we can no longer accept.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="part2">
            <h2>Part II: What We Imagine Instead</h2>
            <p>Imagine opening your phone one morning to find an alert: a small windfall has landed in your wallet. You did nothing to earn it. An algorithm spun a global roulette wheel, and your address came up. Tomorrow, it might be someone in Rio or Reykjavík.</p>
            <p>This is Random Transfer of Wealth (RTW), the heart of SET Coin. It is not a handout; it is a counter-entropy pulse injected directly into the economy. We envision an automated basic-income engine living on a public blockchain, governed by a single, unwavering rule: a small slice of the total money supply-one percent a year-will jump at random from wherever it is held and land only in the accounts of verified individuals. Every coin, whether in a billionaire's hedge fund or a village credit coop, is subject to the same law.</p>
            <p>This mechanism is designed to be less like charity and more like economic weather: unpredictable in the small, predictable in the large, and impossible to lobby. It is a perpetual Jubilee, automated and continuous, where the floor of wealth for everyone can rise faster than the ceiling for a few.</p>
            <blockquote>We imagine a world where wealth is not a stagnant pool, but a flowing river, constantly nourishing the entire economic landscape.</blockquote>

        <section id="part3">
            <h2>Part III: What We Commit To</h2>
            <p>A vision requires principles. A revolution requires responsibility. We commit not just to a new technology, but to a new standard of justice.</p>
            
            <p><strong>We commit to automation without alienation.</strong><br>
            We will use civics-grade code, not casino capitalism, to replace the friction and bias of bureaucracy with the elegance of mathematical randomness. Our goal is an automated system that serves human dignity, not one that deepens the divide.</p>

            <p><strong>We believe dignity is not a luxury.</strong><br>
            This system is designed to dodge the dependence trap. The expected gains are enough to provide basic security but not replace work. Behavioral economics shows that such windfalls-unpredictable and feeling like found money- are often spent on upward mobility: school fees, engine repairs, a new tool for a trade. It is a system that smooths the shocks of life, freeing people to take the small risks that lead to larger ladders of opportunity.</p>
            
            <p><strong>We build not just a system, but a standard of fairness.</strong><br>
            Our work implements a profound ethical principle as code: Rawls's "veil of ignorance." The system is designed as if none of us know where we will land in society. Every holder faces the same one-percent haircut; every verified person shares the same lottery odds. This is fairness, written in software.</p>

            <p><strong>We commit to an architecture of access.</strong><br>
            Our foundation will be secure, programmable, and built for a billion users. We will ensure that ordinary transfers are always free, because financial inclusion cannot have a cover charge.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="part4">
            <h2>Part IV: What We Ask From the World</h2>
            <p>Al is about to amplify winner-take-all dynamics; in this decade, we must build a counter-force just as automatic. Blockchain tooling is finally mature enough to make this possible. Before the next billion are left behind, we must act.</p>
            <p>The vision of SET Coin is a public good, and it demands a global coalition.</p>
            <p><strong>We ask developers, cryptographers, and researchers:</strong> Help us build this. Scrutinize our code and poke holes in our math. The challenge of creating a fair, private, and universal digital identity is immense. We open our work to you and invite you to help us solve it.</p>
            <p><strong>We ask foundations, NGOs, and social organizations:</strong> We offer you a tool. Imagine your programs running on a platform where aid is direct, transparent, and imbued with the dignity of surprise. We ask you to build with us.</p>
            <p><strong>We ask businesses and service providers:</strong> Join this new economy. See this not as a cost, but as a gateway to the largest untapped market on Earth. Offer your services, from education to internet access, and become part of a truly global and inclusive marketplace.</p>
            <p><strong>We ask every individual who feels the injustice of our time:</strong> This is not a thought experiment. This is a call to action. Discuss these ideas, challenge the status quo, and join the community of pioneers who believe a better world is not only possible, but programmable.</p>

            <p>This is our commitment.</p>
            <p>This is your invitation.</p>
            <p>Let us build a currency of dignity—together.</p>
